      <p id="p_BM205_46">(a) Pre-Contract cost authorization shall be reviewed by legal counsel and approved by the cognizant HCD or FCO before issuance. As a condition precedent to the use of a pre-contract cost agreement, the correct type of funds must be available upon issuance of the pre-contract cost agreement. Authorization must be in writing and shall address the following:</p>
      <p id="crXLPV" outputclass="List3">(i) The necessity for the contractor to initiate work prior to contract award</p>
      <p id="gWMXWf" outputclass="List3">(ii) The start date of such contractor effort</p>
      <p id="WdhoRa" outputclass="List3">(iii) The total estimated time of the advanced effort</p>
      <p id="lSqbrv" outputclass="List3">(iv) The cost limitation</p>
      <p id="fWADIO">(b) Indicate on the Standard Form 26, Award/Contract, Block 15, and in Section G of any resultant contract the date pre-contract costs were approved. This notifies the payment office that the pre-contract costs are allowable and that the contractor may be reimbursed. The effective date of the contract shall be the date parties reach a bilateral agreement.</p>
      <p id="jCIpyw">(c) Pre-contract cost authorization shall not be used to cover a period in excess of 30 days or $100,000, unless a longer period/larger dollar threshold is approved by the HCA via a written determination and findings that such an allowance is reasonable, and shall not be extended or renewed.</p>
