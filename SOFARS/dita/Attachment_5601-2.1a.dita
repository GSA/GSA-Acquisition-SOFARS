                     <p id="NzsEqH">In determining the value of OTs for the purposes of assessing compliance with the authority levels set forth below, OTs will be measured based on the value of each transaction, rather than the total value of all OTs that might be executed in a prototype project or for follow-on production. That is, a prototype project may consist of multiple transactions to the same or different parties, each of which shall be considered separately when considering dollar thresholds. Transaction value shall include all options with prices established in the OT as awarded, as well as the amount associated with any cost-sharing borne by the contractor where the basis for the OT is subsection 2371b(d)(l)(C). Regardless of value, a separate OT approval will be required for each phase prototype or follow-on production-and separately within a phase for each transaction.</p>
